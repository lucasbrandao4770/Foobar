# What is the Foobar Challenge
"Google's Foobar Challenge is believed to be a secret hiring process by the company to recruit top programmers and developers around the world. And it is known that several developers at Google are hired by this process.

The challenge consists of five levels with a total of nine questions, with the level of difficulty increasing at each level."

Even without the hiring thing, it's still an exciting programming challenge to solve!
